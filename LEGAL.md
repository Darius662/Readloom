## How Readloom Works

### Metadata Collection

Readloom fetches metadata (titles, descriptions, cover images, release dates) from public APIs:
- **AniList**: Manga metadata and release information
- **MangaDex**: Manga information and volume counts
- **Google Books**: Book metadata
- **Open Library**: Book information
- **ISBNdb**: ISBN-based book data

This metadata is used solely for organizing your personal library and is subject to the terms of service of each respective API provider.

### File Management

Readloom:
- **Does NOT download** any copyrighted content
- **Does NOT host** files on external servers
- **Does NOT share** your files with other users
- **Only organizes** files that already exist on your local system

All file management happens on your own server or computer. Readloom simply provides a web interface to organize and track these files.

## Privacy and Data

### Self-Hosted

Readloom is designed to be self-hosted, meaning:
- All your data stays on your own server
- No data is sent to external servers (except API calls for metadata)
- You have full control over your information
- No telemetry or tracking is performed

### No Content Distribution

Readloom does not:
- Share your library with other users
- Upload your files to the internet
- Create public links to your content
- Enable peer-to-peer sharing

## Comparison to Similar Tools

Readloom operates under the same principles as other popular media management tools:

- **Plex / Jellyfin**: Video library management
- **Calibre**: Ebook library management  
- **Komga / Kavita**: Comic/manga library management
- **Sonarr / Radarr**: Media tracking and organization

Like these tools, Readloom is a **management interface** for content you already own or have legal access to.
